# SKYGUARDIS
SKYDOME is a mixed C++/Ada software-in-the-loop simulator of a short-range air-defence unit. C++ implements the command-and-control layer with radar track handling and threat evaluation, while Ada runs the real-time, safety-critical gun-control and engagement logic, demonstrating deterministic control and high-integrity design.
